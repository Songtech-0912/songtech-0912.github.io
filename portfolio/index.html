<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
<p>I am a current undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> majoring in Applied Physics. In addition, I am the <strong><a href="https://elaraproject.org/">Head of Project Elara</a></strong>, a not-for-profit research organization that develops open-source technologies. I am always glad to learn new skills and work on new things!</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p><a href="https://research.elaraproject.org/">My research</a> is in the fields of computational electromagnetics for space-based energy applications. I develop theoretical models and numerical simulations for power transmission in the microwave spectrum, which may one day allow for beaming power from space to Earth. In addition, I previously did research with the Rensselaer-based <a href="https://materials-intelligence.com/">Materials Intelligence</a> group, using machine learning for materials discovery.</p>
<h3 id="technical-writing-and-science-outreach">Technical writing and science outreach</h3>
<p>I believe firmly in the importance of scientific education and making it accessible to everyone. I have written <a href="https://jackysci.com/notes/">several hundred pages</a> of STEM notes aimed at providing a complete undergraduate-level education in the sciences (in particular physics) to anyone, as well as being a major contributor to the official Handbook of <a href="https://elaraproject.org/elara-handbook/">Project Elara</a>. Currently, I am also working on <a href="https://learntheoreticalphysics.com/">a series of theoretical physics books</a> designed for a general audience.</p>
<h3 id="software-development">Software development</h3>
<p>I am an active developer with experience in web development, scientific computing, Rust, and Python development, with over 80 open-source GitHub repositories. See my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/songtech-0912/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="design-vfx-and-3d-graphics">Design, VFX, and 3D graphics</h3>
<p>In addition to scientific work, I have experience in UI/UX design and have been a longtime web designer and contributor to the visual effects software <a href="https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron">Natron</a>. I am also a 3D/VFX artist, with a portfolio on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/songtech-0912">Artstation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="musical-performance-and-composition">Musical performance and composition</h3>
<p>I am an ABRSM grade 8-certified pianist with 14+ years of experience and can provide musical accompaniment or performance for an ensemble or solo recording. I can also teach piano and general music for all ages up to an intermediate level. In addition, I am a composer with pieces for both solo piano and orchestra <a href="https://lightofhope.site/">available for free listening online</a>.</p>
