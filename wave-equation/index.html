        <p>The wave equation is a ubiquitous partial differential equation found in many areas of physics. In this guide, we will sketch out the basic approach to solving it.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>First, let's state the problem. The wave equation is given by:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$
</p>
<p>Unlike many partial differential equations, the wave equation is actually solvable, and as such it not only carries significant physical importance, but also serves as a useful demonstration of the methods of solving PDEs.</p>
<p>First, notice that the equation is <strong>linear</strong>. That means all the terms of $u(x, t)$ and its derivatives are at most, scaled by a constant, and added (or subtracted) together. This is a powerful fact, because that means any two solutions can be added (or subtracted) together and scaled by constants to form a new solution that satisfies the equation:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u_1(x, t) \pm u_2(x, t) = u_3(x, t)
$$
</p>
<p>We are going to prove that a solution to the wave equation can be put in the general form:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = A \sin(x - vt + \phi_0) \pm B \sin(x + vt + \phi_0)
$$
</p>
<p>To do this, we will first say that our solution $u(x, t)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one of time, and one of space:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = f(x) g(t)
$$
</p>
<p>Now, we can take the derivatives of $u(x, t)$ with respect to each variable:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} g(t) = f&#x27;&#x27; g \\
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \frac{d^2 g}{dt^2} f(x) = g&#x27;&#x27; f
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
<p>We can plug these derivatives into the equation, to have:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
g&#x27;&#x27;f - c^2 f&#x27;&#x27;g = 0
$$
</p>
<p>We can move the second term to the right side of the equation:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
g&#x27;&#x27;f = c^2 f&#x27;&#x27;g
$$
</p>
<p>And we can rearrange the terms to make each side in terms of only one variable - this is called <strong>separation of variables</strong>:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\frac{g&#x27;&#x27;}{g} \frac{1}{c^2} = \frac{f&#x27;&#x27;}{f}
$$
</p>
<p>Now, recognize that the left hand side depends on $g$, and the right hand side depends on $f$, but the values of the derivatives are the same, up to a scaling constant. The only way two derivatives of otherwise unrelated variables would be the same is if both yield a constant, which we'll call $C_1$:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\frac{f&#x27;&#x27;}{f}  = \frac{g&#x27;&#x27;}{g}\frac{1}{c^2} = C_1
$$
</p>
<p>This yields a set of two ordinary differential equations:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\begin{align*}
f&#x27;&#x27; &amp;= C_1 f \\
g&#x27;&#x27; &amp;= c^2 C_1 g
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
<p>If we set $C_2 = -C_1$, and rewrite both equations in terms of $C_2$, the equations immediately start to look familiar: they are the differential equations of both the sine and cosine functions.</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
\begin{align*}
f&#x27;&#x27; &amp;= -C_2 f \\
g&#x27;&#x27; &amp;= -c^2 C_2 g
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
<p>The solution to the first differential equation is:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
f(x) = C_2 \sin (x)
$$
</p>
<p>And that of the second is:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
g(t) = C_2 \sin(ct)
$$
</p>
<p>So if we plug that back into $u(x, t)$, we have:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = f(x) g(t) = C_2 \sin (x)C_2 \sin(ct)
$$
</p>
<p>If we use a trig identity, where $C_3 = \frac{(C_2)^2}{2}$, this becomes:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = C_3 \cos(x - ct) - C_3\cos (x + ct))
$$
</p>
<p>Since we can write any cosine as a sine with a phase shift, we have:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = C_3 \sin(x - ct + \phi_0) - C_3 \sin(x + ct + \phi_0)
$$
</p>
<p>Replacing $C_3$ with arbitrary constants $A$ and $B$, and changing the subtraction to $\pm$, which we can do by simply defining $B = -C_3$, we have:</p>
<p class="mathcell">
$$
u(x, t) = A \sin (x - vt + \phi_0) \pm B \sin(x + vt + \phi_0)
$$
</p>
<p>Which is the <strong>solution</strong> of the wave equation. Note that it is not the only solution, as the specific solution to the wave equations depends on the <em>boundary conditions</em>, which are additional constraints on the form of $u(x, t)$ - we did not provide boundary conditions to the problem for simplicity. However, it is a solution, and indeed, an important solution, because it describes <strong>standing waves</strong> in physics, like the vibrations of a string or a drumhead, as well as radio waves in a metal box.
