## The standard model

The standard model is one of the most successful theories in physics. Within the standard model, there are several categories of particles. The standard model describes a number of elementary particles - point particles that have no volume and are indivisible. The elementary particles include:

- Fermions (spin-1/2 particles, which include 6 quarks, 6 leptons, and their antiparticles)
- Gauge bosons (these are force carriers with integer spin, which are the photon, gluon, W, and Z)
- Scalar bosons (the Higgs boson)

Quarks are the building blocks of hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. They are never found in isolation, and always found within hadrons. They have half-integer spin, but unlike leptons, they interact with the strong force as well as the weak force.

Leptons are composed of electrons, muons, and tauons, as well as their respective neutrinos. They also have half-integer spin, but do not interact with the strong force.

Gauge bosons are massless with exception of the W and Z bosons. Each carries a fundamental interaction - the photon is the force carrier of electromagnetism, the gluon carries the strong force, and the W & Z bosons carry the weak force.

Composite particles are composed of elementary particles, and include hadrons (mesons and baryons), and everything made of them (such as atoms and molecules). Elementary particles are thought to be point particles that have mass but no volume, whereas composite particles do have a volume.

## Units in physics

Velocity is often measured relative to the speed of light, such as $0.8c$. Charge is often measured with respect to the elementary charge, such as $5e$. Energy is often measured in terms of electron volts (eV), where $1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$.
