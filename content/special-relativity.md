## The standard model

The standard model is one of the most successful theories in physics. Within the standard model, there are several categories of particles. First, elementary particles are:

- Fermions (spin-1/2 particles, which include 6 quarks, 6 leptons, and their antiparticles)
- Gauge bosons (these are force carriers, which are the photon, gluon, W, and Z)
- Scalar bosons (the Higgs boson)

Composite particles are composed of elementary particles, and include hadrons (mesons and baryons), and everything made of them (such as atoms and molecules). Elementary particles are thought to be point particles that have mass but no volume, whereas composite particles do have a volume.

## Units in physics

Velocity is often measured relative to the speed of light, such as $0.8c$. Charge is often measured with respect to the elementary charge, such as $5e$. Energy is often measured in terms of electron volts (eV), where $1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$.
