These are notes I've taken while pursuing a degree in Applied Physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, as well in my independent research and learning. Most of these notes are aimed at a college undergraduate or advanced high school level.

Where external licensed/copyrighted material is included, it is used under fair-use for purely educational purposes. Other than that, these notes are my own work and are **freely usable with no restrictions**. That is to say, they are dedicated to the public domain, or if your jurisdiction does not support that, provided under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/).

A lot of these notes contain graphics/equations. Equations can be copied just by selecting and Ctrl/Command + C; for graphics, right-click and you should be able to choose "save as image" to download. There is work-in-progress support for AI-generated image descriptions for screenreaders.
