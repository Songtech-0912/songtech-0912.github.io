These are notes (well, more mini-books), some I've taken while pursuing a degree in applied physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, others in my independent research and learning. Most of these notes are aimed at a college undergraduate or advanced high school level, some at a graduate level, but I firmly believe that anyone with a curious mind and a determined willingness to learn can read through and get to understand all of them.

Where external licensed/copyrighted material is included, it is used under fair-use for purely educational purposes. Other than that, these notes are my own work and are **freely usable with no restrictions**. That is to say, they are dedicated to the public domain, or if your jurisdiction does not support that, provided under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/).

A lot of these notes contain graphics/equations. Equations can be copied just by selecting and Ctrl/Command + C; for graphics, right-click and you should be able to choose "save as image" to download. There is work-in-progress support for AI-generated image descriptions for screenreaders.

Interested in how I make these notes? See [here](@/notes-process.md) for my workflow.
