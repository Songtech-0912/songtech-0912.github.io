## DNA

**DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains all the instructions used to build a living organism. It is a molecular blueprint for a living organisms, organized in a double helix shape, and first discovered in 1953.

DNA is built of nucleotides - molecules that are like letters in the DNA alphabet. There are four nucleotides, A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine) and T (thymine). Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate group, sugar (deoxyribose) and nitrogenous base. Each "ladder" in the DNA helix contains two base pairs - A is complementary with T, and C is complementary with G.

Nucleotides can be (confusingly classified) into two categories:

- Purines: adenine and guanine (A, G)
- Pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine (C, T)

The most important functions of DNA include:

- The **storage** of genetic information
- The ability to **replicate** to facilitate cell division
- The ability to be translated into amino acids to create proteins
- Generate genetic variation by adding minor alterations to gene information over time

## Polarity of DNA

We can describe the direction of DNA by referring to its 5' and 3' ends. The 5' end is the direction of the phosphate attached to the 5th carbon of the sugar, whereas the 3' end is the direction of the free hydroxyl group attached to the 3rd carbon of the sugar.

## DNA replication

DNA replication always takes place in the 5' to 3' direction, and takes several steps:

- Proteins bind to locations on the DNA called origins of replication to form the **pre-replication complex**
- The two strands of DNA are separated
	- Helicase proteins untwist and unzip DNA along both directions of the origin using ATP as their energy source
	- Single-stranded binding proteins prevents DNA from degradation during replication
- Within the replication bubble (the unzipped region of DNA) DNA replication begins:
    - Single-stranded binding protein (SSBP) keeps replication bubble open
    - Primase starts a new stand of RNA primer (a nucleotide sequence that is complimentary to the DNA strand) in the 5' -> 3' direction
    - DNA polymerase III synthesizes DNA from the RNA primers by moving 5' -> 3'
    - Disconnected fragments of strands synthesized by DNA polymerase III are called Okazaki fragments and their RNA is replaced by DNA using DNA polymerase I
    - Ligase creates phosphodiester bonds between Okazaki fragments to link strands together into a continuous strand
    - DNA polymerase III uses proofreading to check for mismatched base pairs

| Protein | Function |
|---------|----------|
| DNA polymerase I | Replace RNA primer with DNA |
| DNA polymerase III | Extend RNA primers with DNA |
| Helicase | Separates strands of DNA |
| Primase | Makes RNA primers |
| Ligase | Seals gaps in DNA |

## Packaging DNA

The DNA of a single cell completely unwound would take up to 2 meters in length. Thus, DNA is tightly wound around proteins called histones that link together to form nucleosomes. These are then bound together, then looped and condensed to finally form chromosomes.

## Central Dogma of Biology

The **central dogma of biology** is that DNA transcribes to form RNA, RNA translates to form proteins.

## The genetic code

The genetic code is the set of rules that converts RNA base sequences to amino acid sequences that are used to make proteins. There are 20 amino acids, a fact first suggested by George Gamow. The code is based on sets of 3 nucleotides, called codons, and the code is redundant, meaning more than one codon can code for the same amino acid.

## Genes and genetic variation

A **gene** is a group of base sequences that code for specific amino acids that form proteins. A gene determines the phenotype (observable characteristics) of an organism and are heritable.

## Mutations

A **mutation** is a change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA caused by random chance. In some cases, it can be **base substitutions** - one nucleotide could be replaced with another. In other cases, it can be deletions or insertions, which can lead to significant changes in the amino acids sequence and correspondingly the proteins produced. For instance, a single base substitution causes sickle cell anemia.
