## Evolution
### Formation of Earth

Billions of years ago, a supernova explosion created a nebula in where the solar system is today. While the majority of the gases in the solar system gathered to form the sun, the cloud of rocks and dust clumped together to form planets, which became rounded because of gravity. Earth itself was formed around 4.5 billion years ago.
Due to the molten conditions on Earth at the time, heavy elements such as iron sank deep inside the Earth, and lighter elements floated to the top - this is called the **iron catastrophe**. This in turn created Earth's molten inner core, which created Earth's magnetic field, protecting it from damaging solar radiation.

## Stages of Earth

### Black Earth (4.5 BYA)

- Earth was hot molten rock that began to cool and solidify to basaltic rock (modern-day oceanic crust)
- Nothing survived from this stage

### Gray Earth (4.3 BYA)

- Intense heat and pressure in the early Earth causes new minerals to form
- Granite becomes the foundation of our continents
- No life yet

### Blue Earth (3.8 BYA)

- Earth cools enough for liquid water; water is a universal solvent which allows for organic chemistry to take place
- Zircon crystals which could have only formed in the presence of water provides evidence that liquid oceans were present by 4.3 billion years ago
- Life began at around 3.8 billion years ago; stromatolite fossils dated to 3.5 billion years ago

### Red Earth (3.5 BYA)

- Photosynthesizing microbes released a large amount of oxygen, rusting iron and causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea
- Oxygen also causes the formation of more minerals

### White Earth (540 MYA)

- Earth plunged into a deep freeze, life is nearly wiped out
- Volcanic activity melts the Earth and destabilizes the atmosphere

### Green Earth (520 MYA - present)

- Diversity of life exploded
- Life creates and sculpts its surroundings

## The origin of life

### Building blocks of life

All elements are forged in the interior of stars. Stars fuse lighter elements (such as hydrogen and helium) into heavier elements, up to iron. Elements are heavier than iron are produced by supernovae. Many carbon-based molecules are brought to Earth by asteroids and comets, and early oceans allow basic organic compounds to form.

### Complex biomolecules

The Stanley-Miller experiments in the 1950s showed that a simulation of the atmosphere of early Earth (composed of water vapor, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen), combined with water, heat, and lightning, was able to synthesize simple organic compounds including amino acids. Simple organic compounds combined to form more complex organic compounds. RNA became the original self-replicating molecule, used to encode genetic information. Later, proteins and DNA formed.

### Membrane enclosure

The cell membranes of all living organisms are made of **phospholipid bilayers** that are composed of fatty acids. The head is hydrophilic and the tail is hydrophobic. When exposed to water, the bilayer spontaneously forms a two-layered sheet with the tails pointing toward the center. The membrane is permeable, allowing RNA nucleotides (building blocks of RNA) to enter.
With the combination of RNA and membranes, protocells form. While not life, they do have similar characteristics, such as growth and division.

### Selection and evolutionary change

The replication of RNA molecules within the protocell creates an osmotic gradient; the cell membrane stretches grabs fatty acids from tmembranes of cells with lower RNA replication rates. Therefore, protocells with higher rates of RNA synthesis grow faster, and outcompete protocells with little or no RNA. The replication process of RNA causes better versions of RNA that in turn get better at replicating.
