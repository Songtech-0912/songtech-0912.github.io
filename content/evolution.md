## The scientific method

- Independent variable - what is varied
- Potentially confounding (control) variables - what is kept constant
- Dependent variable - what is measured
- Experimental group (treatment) - the group that has been subjected to the differing independent variable
- Control group (treatment) - the group that has not been subjected to the differing independent variable
- Experimental units - the unit that the experimental group is tested on
- Replicates - repeated experiments carried out to improve accuracy
- Scope of inference - how general the results of an experiment are; with more replication the scope is greater

## Evolution

### Formation of Earth

Billions of years ago, a supernova explosion created a nebula in where the solar system is today. While the majority of the gases in the solar system gathered to form the sun, the cloud of rocks and dust clumped together to form planets, which became rounded because of gravity. Earth itself was formed around 4.5 billion years ago.
Due to the molten conditions on Earth at the time, heavy elements such as iron sank deep inside the Earth, and lighter elements floated to the top - this is called the **iron catastrophe**. This in turn created Earth's molten inner core, which created Earth's magnetic field, protecting it from damaging solar radiation.

## Stages of Earth

### Black Earth (4.5 BYA)

- Earth was hot molten rock that began to cool and solidify to basaltic rock (modern-day oceanic crust)
- Nothing survived from this stage

### Gray Earth (4.3 BYA)

- Intense heat and pressure in the early Earth causes new minerals to form
- Granite becomes the foundation of our continents
- No life yet

### Blue Earth (3.8 BYA)

- Earth cools enough for liquid water; water is a universal solvent which allows for organic chemistry to take place
- Zircon crystals which could have only formed in the presence of water provides evidence that liquid oceans were present by 4.3 billion years ago
- Life began at around 3.8 billion years ago; stromatolite fossils dated to 3.5 billion years ago

### Red Earth (3.5 BYA)

- Photosynthesizing microbes released a large amount of oxygen, rusting iron and causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea
- Oxygen also causes the formation of more minerals

### White Earth (540 MYA)

- Earth plunged into a deep freeze, life is nearly wiped out
- Volcanic activity melts the Earth and destabilizes the atmosphere

### Green Earth (520 MYA - present)

- Diversity of life exploded
- Life creates and sculpts its surroundings

## The origin of life

### Building blocks of life

All elements are forged in the interior of stars. Stars fuse lighter elements (such as hydrogen and helium) into heavier elements, up to iron. Elements are heavier than iron are produced by supernovae. Many carbon-based molecules are brought to Earth by asteroids and comets, and early oceans allow basic organic compounds to form.

### Complex biomolecules

The Stanley-Miller experiments in the 1950s showed that a simulation of the atmosphere of early Earth (composed of water vapor, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen), combined with water, heat, and lightning, was able to synthesize simple organic compounds including amino acids. Simple organic compounds combined to form more complex organic compounds. RNA became the original self-replicating molecule, used to encode genetic information. Later, proteins and DNA formed.

### Membrane enclosure

The cell membranes of all living organisms are made of **phospholipid bilayers** that are composed of fatty acids. The head is hydrophilic and the tail is hydrophobic. When exposed to water, the bilayer spontaneously forms a two-layered sheet with the tails pointing toward the center. The membrane is permeable, allowing RNA nucleotides (building blocks of RNA) to enter.
With the combination of RNA and membranes, protocells form. While not life, they do have similar characteristics, such as growth and division.

### Selection and evolutionary change

The replication of RNA molecules within the protocell creates an osmotic gradient; the cell membrane stretches grabs fatty acids from the membranes of cells with lower RNA replication rates. Therefore, protocells with higher rates of RNA synthesis grow faster, and outcompete protocells with little or no RNA. The replication process of RNA causes better versions of RNA that in turn get better at replicating.

## Protocells vs living cells

Protocells are **not** living cells, but they had many characteristics similar to modern-day living cells, such as lipid bilayer cell membranes, RNA composed of nucleotides.

## Potential life outside of Earth

Scientists believe that life can exist on worlds other than Earth, especially on planets in a star's habitable zone, which corresponds to the range of orbital distances where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. We detect planets by looking for dips in brightness of a star, which indicate planets transiting (crossing in front of) the star. Space telescopes we use for this purpose include TESS, Kepler, and JWST. The **Fermi Paradox** is the question of why we haven't found life yet if there are so many planets out there.

## Emergence

Emergence is the property of a system that has different properties than the sum of its parts. For example, the neurons in the brain are each not conscious, but billions of neurons attached together allow human beings to think, reason, and be self-aware. Life is the **ultimate** emergent property.

Due to the increase in entropy in every physical system as demanded by the 2nd law of thermodynamics, highly ordered systems all inevitably decay into disordered systems. Life escapes this process by constantly taking in energy from its environment - this is called a **metabolism**.

## The definition of life

Something is considered alive if it satisfies the following characteristics:

- Growth
- Response
- Heredity
- Homeostasis (regulates its internal state)
- Metabolism (converting / using energy to perform a function)
- Reproduction
- Order

## Early evolution of life

### Hadean Eon 

Protocells emerge at the start of the Hadeon eon (4 BYA). Bacteria becomes the first type of life to arise (3.8 BYA).

### Archean Eon

Archaea becomes the second domain of life, thriving in extreme environments (3.7 BYA). Later on, (initially anaerobic) photosynthetic bacteria such as _Aquifex_.

### Great oxidation event

Aerobic cyanobacteria develop and form stromatolites (3.5 - 3 BYA). Eukaryotes (complex cells with nucleus and membrane-bound organelles) develop from archea and appear (2.7 BYA).

**Endosymbiotic theory** is used to explain how eukaryote cells formed - various prokaryotic cells that shared a symbiotic relationship engulfed each other to form the first eukaryotic cells.

### Universal features of life

All living cells are:

- Enclosed by a membrane
- Store hereditary information in DNA
- Replicate DNA and use RNA for DNA transcription
- Have ribosomes and proteins to catalyze cellular reactions

### Photosynthesis

Early on in the atmosphere, there was no oxygen, as oxygen is highly reactive. After oxygen levels rose, aerobic respiration became the dominant form of metabolism within cells. Chloroplasts primarily perform photosynthesis in plants.

### Snowball earth

Due to the increase in oxygen from the great oxidation event, greenhouse gases are reduced dramatically, causing the entire planet to cool down and freeze over. Volcanic activity melted the ice and returned Earth to normal temperatures (~650 MYA).

### Ediacaran

The most ancient complex organisms are from the Ediacaran (600 - 540 MYA), and all lived in the oceans and didn't have shells. There is very little we know about them.

### The Cambrian explosion

Most of the Ediacaran life forms were extinct by 540 MYA. In their place, thousands of new species emerged in the **Cambrian Explosion**. These species developed modern body plans, hard shells, locomotion, nervous systems and sensory organs. Theorized causes of the Cambrian explosion include increased oxygen, increased minerals due to weathering, and the development of vision. 

### Tiktaalik

At 360 MYA, the species Tiktaalik appeared, a transitory animal between ocean and land animals. Fully land-bound creatures appeared soon after.
