## Portfolio

I am a current undergraduate student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) majoring in Applied Physics. In addition, I am the **[Head of Project Elara](https://elaraproject.org/)**, a not-for-profit research organization that develops open-source technologies. I am always glad to learn new skills and work on new things!

### Research

[My research](https://research.elaraproject.org/) is in the fields of computational electromagnetics for space-based energy applications. I develop theoretical models and numerical simulations for power transmission in the microwave spectrum, which may one day allow for beaming power from space to Earth. In addition, I previously did research with the Rensselaer-based [Materials Intelligence](https://materials-intelligence.com/) group, using machine learning for materials discovery.

### Technical writing and science outreach

I believe firmly in the importance of scientific education and making it accessible to everyone. I have written [several hundred pages](@/notes.md) of STEM notes aimed at providing a complete undergraduate-level education in the sciences (in particular physics) to anyone, as well as being a major contributor to the official Handbook of [Project Elara](https://elaraproject.org/elara-handbook/). Currently, I am also working on [a series of theoretical physics books](https://learntheoreticalphysics.com/) designed for a general audience.

### Software development

I am an active developer with experience in web development, scientific computing, Rust, and Python development, with over 80 open-source GitHub repositories. See my GitHub [here](https://github.com/songtech-0912/).

### Design, VFX, and 3D graphics

In addition to scientific work, I have experience in UI/UX design and have been a longtime web designer and contributor to the visual effects software [Natron](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron). I am also a 3D/VFX artist, with a portfolio on [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/songtech-0912).

### Musical performance and composition

I am an ABRSM grade 8-certified pianist with 14+ years of experience and can provide musical accompaniment or performance for an ensemble or solo recording. I can also teach piano and general music for all ages up to an intermediate level. In addition, I am a composer with pieces for both solo piano and orchestra [available for free listening online](https://lightofhope.site/).
