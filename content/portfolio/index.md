## Portfolio

### Research

My research is in the fields of computational electromagnetics for space-based energy applications. I am the director of [Project Elara](https://elaraproject.github.io/), the nonprofit I do this research through.

### Software development

I am an active developer with experience in web development, scientific computing, and Python development, with over 70 GitHub repositories. See my GitHub [here](https://github.com/songtech-0912/).

### Design, VFX, and 3D graphics

In addition to scientific work, I am also skilled at UI/UX design and have been a longtime web designer for the visual effects software [Natron](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron). I am also a 3D/VFX artist, with a portfolio on [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/songtech-0912).

### Musical performance and composition

I am an ABRSM performance grade 8-certified pianist and can provide musical accompaniment or performance for an ensemble or for composition recording, as well as piano and general music teaching for all ages up to an intermediate level. In addition, I am a composer with pieces for both solo piano and orchestra.
