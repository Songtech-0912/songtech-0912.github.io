Our understanding of physics is more complete than at any time in the past. But our modern physics theories have some of the most tedious calculations imaginable, which stands in the way of scientific progress. So it is crucial to learn to use a computer algebra system (CAS) to expedite the process.

Example calculations: 1-loop semiclassical gravity near black holes and frame-dragging calculations in the ergoregion of a Kerr black hole.
