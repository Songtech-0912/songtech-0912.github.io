## Introducing radians

Of all the angle units we can use, why radians? To understand this question, let us use $S$ to denote the arc length, and $\theta$ to denote the angle.

Idea of a radian is that the subtended arc length is proportional to the angle. The longer the subtended arc length, the bigger the angle, and vice-versa. That is, $S \propto \theta$. This is true of all angle units, whether degrees or radians or gradiants or arcminutes or arcseconds.

However, radians are special in that the proportionality constant is _exactly_ the radius $R$. That is, $S = R \theta$.

The question is - what unit does $\theta$ have to be for this to be true?

To solve this question:


A solution to a differential equation can be expressed as a explicit/implicit quadrature, or at the very least, as a power series or Taylor series, this is one way to solve differential equations when an analytical solution cannot be found. This also offers a way to compute their solutions
