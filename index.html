     <h3>Gravity as an effective field theory, part 1</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Effective field theory is an idea that comes from <a href="https://learntheoreticalphysics.com/quantum-field-theory/">quantum field theory</a>, and forms the backbone of the Standard Model. The core idea of effective field theory is that it gives us an "entry point" to new physics we don't know by assuming that the new physics is hidden behind suppressed high-energy terms; these terms reduce to physics we do know in the low-energy limit. By finding approximate forms for these high-energy terms, we can often successfully make predictions with an incomplete theory. With that in mind, effective field theory is very often discussed purely in the context of quantum field theory, even though it is a far more general idea. In this article, I'll discuss the interesting examples of treating Newtonian gravity and General Relativity as effective field theories, and how it fits in with our currently incomplete <em>quantum</em> theory of gravity.</p>

     <h3>How to think like a physicist</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>There is a tendency by physicists to present their work with jargon, assumption of considerable prior knowledge, and complex, domain-specific language. I think that's a shame, because it obscures the beauty that underlies the physicist's outlook on the world. So I want to try to explain how to really <em>think</em> like a physicist here.</p>

One apparently-simple system that has a very complex physical description is the <strong>elastic pendulum</strong>, and we will solve it here, with the help of Lagrangian mechanics and Python.</p>

     <h3>A &quot;new&quot; way to define functions</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>When we start to learn about differential equations, one of the first things we're taught about them is that they're often unsolvable - a fact that most students just learn to accept. What we're not often taught is <em>why</em> so many differential equations are considered unsolvable. It turns out, it has everything to do with how we define "solving" a differential equation.</p>

     <h3>A proof of the area of a circle</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>Circles are one of the most ubiquitous yet most mysterious objects found in math. This is because its area formula involves a seemingly unlikely object - an irrational number. And yet circles are some of the most common shapes in the universe, and finding the area of circles (or circle-derived objects) is a must for so many applications in math and physics. So we need a way to find the area of a circle.</p>

     <h3>Solving separable partial differential equations</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>Partial differential equations have a reputation for being impossible to solve. And in many cases, this is true - they are extremely difficult to analytically solve for a general solution. However, when a partial differential equation is separable, it can be solved fairly straightforwardly, as a system of ordinary differential equations. Here is how to do so.</p>
