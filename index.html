     <h3>How to think like a physicist</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>There is a tendency by physicists to present their work with jargon, assumption of considerable prior knowledge, and complex, domain-specific language. I think that's a shame, because it obscures the beauty that underlies the physicist's outlook on the world. So I want to try to explain how to really <em>think</em> like a physicist here.</p>

     <h3>Solving the elastic pendulum with Python</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>One of the most surprising aspects of physics is how complex even everyday systems happen to be. One apparently-simple system that has a very complex physical description is the <strong>elastic pendulum</strong>, and we will solve it here, with the help of Lagrangian mechanics and Python.</p>

     <h3>A guide to modern theoretical physics</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>Modern theoretical physics is a vast and technically challenging subject, which is often explained in a very unhelpful manner and with an overwhelming amount of mathematical language that is introduced too quickly. This guide attempts to explain the broad theoretical physics concepts in a clear and relatively less-mathematical/jargon-based way.</p>

     <h3>A &quot;new&quot; way to define functions</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>When we start to learn about differential equations, one of the first things we're taught about them is that they're often unsolvable - a fact that most students just learn to accept. What we're not often taught is <em>why</em> so many differential equations are considered unsolvable. It turns out, it has everything to do with how we define &quot;solving&quot; a differential equation.</p>

     <h3>A proof of the area of a circle</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>Circles are one of the most ubiquitous yet most mysterious objects found in math. This is because its area formula involves a seemingly unlikely object - an irrational number. And yet circles are some of the most common shapes in the universe, and finding the area of circles (or circle-derived objects) is a must for so many applications in math and physics. So we need a way to find the area of a circle.</p>

     <h3>Solving separable partial differential equations</h3>
     <p class="summary"><p>Partial differential equations have a reputation for being impossible to solve. And in many cases, this is true - they are extremely difficult to analytically solve for a general solution. However, when a partial differential equation is separable, it can be solved fairly straightforwardly, as a system of ordinary differential equations. Here is how to do so.</p>
