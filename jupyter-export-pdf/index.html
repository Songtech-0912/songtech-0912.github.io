        <p>It can be a huge hassle trying to export a jupyter notebook to a PDF - there are some ways that involve needing to download hundreds of megabytes (or even gigabytes!) of packages! So I thought I would share the way I use, a very simple way that doesn't involve needing to install <em>anything</em> and is incredibly fast and simple.</p>

<p>In the past, Jupyter notebooks allowed printing the notebook directly from the browser. This was very convenient; exporting PDFs from the browser took just 2 clicks. But starting with Jupyter notebook version 7, this option no longer worked. So instead, I came up with another method based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/78390381">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to export your Jupyter notebook as an HTML file. To do so, go to the toolbar, and press <code>File &gt; Save and Export Notebook As &gt; HTML</code>. A picture of this is shown below:</p>

<p>Jupyter should then automatically prepare an HTML file and download it for you. Locate the downloaded HTML file and move it to <strong>the same directory as your Jupyter notebook</strong>. This is important to make sure that you don't break any relative links (especially for images). Then, you can just use <code>Ctrl + P</code> (or <code>Command + P</code> on macs) to print the webpage as a PDF. I recommend setting the scale in the print dialog to be ~85% as the default setting makes for very large text on the PDF. Then save the PDF wherever you want - and you're done! A quick, easy method that is (relatively) hassle-free and doesn't require installing <em>anything</em> whatsoever.</p>
